            <p>Hummus is one of my favorite foods â€” here's my recipe for perfect hummus, building on a Hebrew recipe from Hummus101.com</p>

            <pre>Ingredients:
                - 2 ~400g cans of chickpeas, one drained and one with liquid
                - 1-2 cloves of garlic (depending on strength)
                - 1 cup of tahini
                - 1 juiced lemon
                - 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil
                - 1 heaped teaspoon of cumin
                - 1 teaspoon of salt
            </pre>

            <p>
                Combine all ingredients in blender/food processor. Blend until smooth or appliance begins to smoke.
            <p>
                The consistency when fresh will be slightly liquid and jiggle when shaken, but it will thicken in the fridge.
            <p>
                It's worth considering the olive oil â€” you can use mild or extra virgin, but a super pungent oil might be too much. Start with one tbsp and taste â€” you might want more
                for a creamier texture.
            <p>
                The original Hummus101 recipe was adamant about cooking the chickpeas from scratch, but the cans are ludicrously convenient in comparison, 
                and the end product was better. ðŸ¤· It's worth using expensive chickpeas â€” a couple Â£/$ more overall but a small difference compared to how much the equivalent
                quantity of hummus you're making would be to buy.

                <p>Top UK store-bought hummus:</p>
                <pre>S Tier:
                    - San Amvrosia Original Hummus
                    - Little Herb Farm Houmous
A Tier:
                    - Meze Hummus
                </pre>
		<p>Delphi, Ramona and Sabra are fine but nowhere near the same level. Maybe B+, B-, C+ respectively.</p> 
                <p>The own-brand supermarket stuff (essential/classic) is so different to good hummus it's not worth comparing. D- tier. They still have the right ingredients so can't be F.
                   Fine for dipping crisps etc. but they're just so bad. 
                <p>In the US the 365-branded (Whole Foods) one is OK, but I actively dislike Trader Joe's options.
